\section{Introduction}

\hspace{1in}This report is basically on what I expect from this course on software tools. The course is expected to cover all the industry required software along with certain languages to help me excel in the field.


\section{Expectation}
The various things expected in this course are-
\hspace{1in}\subsection{Development tools}
\subsubsection{AWS}
\hspace{1in}Amazon web service is a platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions. Cloud computing is a term referred to storing and accessing data over the internet. It doesn't store any data on the hard disk of your personal computer. In cloud computing, you can access data from a remote server.

\subsubsection{Jenkins}
\hspace{1in}Jenkins is an open source Continuous Integration server capable of orchestrating a chain of actions that help to achieve the Continuous Integration process (and not only) in an automated fashion.

 \subsubsection{Rstudio}
 \hspace{1in}RStudio is an open-source tool for programming in R.RStudio is a flexible tool that helps you create readable analyses, and keeps your code, images, comments, and plots together in one place
 
 \vspace{2cm}

 \subsubsection{Git}
 \hspace{1in}Git is the most commonly used version control system.Git is a distributed version control system.These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. You commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server.

 \subsubsection{MATLAB}
 \hspace{1in} The matrix-based MATLAB language is the worldâ€™s most natural way to express computational mathematics. Built-in graphics make it easy to visualize and gain insights from data.

 \subsubsection{LATEX}
 \hspace{1in}Latex is a document preparation system for producing
professional-looking documents, it is not a word processor. It is particularly suited to producing long, structured documents, and is very good at typesetting equations. It is available as free software for most operating systems.
